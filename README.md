This repository contains Python-based projects developed during my internship. The projects include various tools and applications, such as voice assistants, health-related tools, security utilities, and web applications. Below is a brief overview of each project:

## 1. **BMI Calculator**
A tool to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) based on weight and height. It provides classifications such as:
- Underweight
